# Deployment Lessons Learned

## Overview

This document captures critical lessons learned during the development and deployment of the Time Tracking App, covering both local development optimization and AWS deployment challenges.

## üè† Local Development Lessons

### Next.js Configuration Conflicts

**Problem**: Configuring Next.js for AWS static export (`output: 'export'`) caused severe performance issues in local development.

**Symptoms**:
- Slow compilation times (5-10 seconds vs. normal 200ms)
- Missing manifest files errors
- Development server instability
- Frequent restarts required

**Root Cause**: Static export mode forces Next.js to pre-render all pages during development, which is unnecessary and slow for local development.

**Solution**: Dual configuration approach
- `next.config.js` - Fast local development (no export mode)
- `next.config.aws.js` - AWS deployment (export mode with optimizations)
- Deployment script automatically switches configs during build

**Key Takeaway**: Never compromise local development speed for deployment requirements. Use environment-specific configurations.

### Build Directory Cleanup Issues

**Problem**: `.next` directories becoming "stubborn" and refusing deletion, especially on WSL/Linux systems.

**Symptoms**:
- `rm -rf .next` fails with "Directory not empty"
- Hidden `.fuse_hidden*` files preventing cleanup
- Permission issues requiring sudo

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Process cleanup**: Kill any running Next.js processes before cleanup
2. **Hidden file removal**: `sudo rm -rf .next/.fuse_hidden*`
3. **Aggressive cleanup**: Use sudo when regular deletion fails
4. **Graceful degradation**: Multiple cleanup strategies in deployment script

**Key Takeaway**: Always implement robust cleanup strategies in deployment scripts, especially for cross-platform compatibility.

### Development Server Optimization

**Best Practices Discovered**:
- Keep development config minimal and fast
- Avoid static export mode in development
- Use separate configs for different environments
- Implement proper process cleanup in scripts

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment Lessons

### CDK Bootstrap and Permissions

**Challenge**: Initial CDK deployment requires proper bootstrapping and IAM permissions.

**Lessons**:
- Always check for CDK bootstrap before first deployment
- Root user credentials work but show warnings about role assumptions
- Bootstrap is region-specific and only needed once per region
- CDK automatically creates necessary IAM roles during bootstrap

**Implementation**:
```bash
# Check if bootstrap exists
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name CDKToolkit --region $REGION

# Bootstrap if needed
npx cdk bootstrap aws://$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)/$REGION
```

### Static Export Configuration

**Critical Discovery**: AWS S3 static hosting requires specific Next.js configuration.

**Required Settings**:
```javascript
{
  output: 'export',           // Generate static files
  distDir: 'out',            // Output to 'out' directory
  trailingSlash: true,       // S3 routing compatibility
  images: { unoptimized: true }, // No server-side image optimization
  eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true }, // Skip linting for faster builds
  typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true } // Skip TS errors for MVP
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Static hosting has different requirements than server-side rendering. Optimize configs accordingly.

### S3 Website Hosting vs. CloudFront

**Decision**: Started with S3-only hosting for MVP simplicity.

**S3 Website Hosting Pros**:
- Simple setup and configuration
- Cost-effective (~$1-5/month)
- Fast deployment (2-3 minutes)
- No CDN complexity

**S3 Website Hosting Cons**:
- HTTP only (no HTTPS)
- Limited to AWS region performance
- No advanced caching controls

**Future Consideration**: Add CloudFront for HTTPS and global performance when needed.

### Infrastructure as Code Benefits

**CDK Advantages Realized**:
- Reproducible deployments
- Automatic resource management
- Easy cleanup with stack deletion
- Version control for infrastructure
- Automatic dependency resolution

**Best Practice**: Always use IaC (CDK/CloudFormation) instead of manual AWS console configuration.

## üîß Script Development Lessons

### Error Handling and User Experience

**Implemented Patterns**:
- Colored output for better readability
- Clear step-by-step progress indicators
- Graceful error handling with helpful messages
- Automatic cleanup and recovery strategies

**Example**:
```bash
print_error() {
    echo -e "${RED}[ERROR]${NC} $1"
}

print_success() {
    echo -e "${GREEN}[SUCCESS]${NC} $1"
}
```

### Configuration Management

**Lesson**: Centralize configuration and make it easily modifiable.

**Implementation**:
- Environment variable support (`AWS_REGION=eu-west-1 ./deploy.sh`)
- Default values with fallbacks
- Clear configuration section at script top
- Consistent naming conventions

### Deployment Workflow Optimization

**Optimal Flow Discovered**:
1. Prerequisites check (fail fast)
2. Dependency installation (conditional)
3. Clean build environment
4. Build with appropriate config
5. Deploy infrastructure
6. Display results with next steps

**Key Insight**: Front-load validation to catch issues early and provide clear feedback throughout.

- `aws-deployment-guide.md`
- `aws-quick-guide.md`
- `aws-sync-guide.md`
- `aws-troubleshooting.md`

### After: Streamlined Structure
- `aws-deployment-guide.md` - Comprehensive MVP guide
- `aws-readme.md` - Quick start and overview
- `aws-troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `deployment.md` - All deployment options

**Lesson**: Consolidate documentation to reduce confusion and maintenance overhead.

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

### Build Time Improvements

**Strategies**:
- Skip ESLint/TypeScript checks in deployment builds
- Use conditional dependency installation
- Implement smart cleanup (only when needed)
- Parallel asset building in CDK

**Results**:
- Local development: ~1.8s startup, ~200ms recompiles
- AWS build: ~2.5s for static export
- Total deployment: ~2-3 minutes

### Cost Optimization

**MVP Approach**:
- S3 static hosting instead of EC2/ECS
- No CloudFront initially

## üîç Troubleshooting Patterns

### Common Error Patterns and Solutions

**1. "Cannot find asset at /path/to/out"**
- **Cause**: Next.js config mismatch between build and CDK expectations
- **Solution**: Ensure `output: 'export'` and `distDir: 'out'` in AWS config
- **Prevention**: Verify build output directory exists before CDK deployment

**2. "Directory not empty" during cleanup**
- **Cause**: File system locks, hidden files, or running processes
- **Solution**: Kill processes, remove hidden files, use sudo if needed
- **Prevention**: Implement multi-stage cleanup in scripts

**3. "Unable to locate credentials"**
- **Cause**: AWS CLI not configured or expired credentials
- **Solution**: Run `aws configure` or refresh credentials
- **Prevention**: Add credential validation to deployment scripts

**4. CDK Bootstrap warnings**
- **Cause**: Using root credentials instead of IAM roles
- **Solution**: Create dedicated deployment IAM user (future improvement)
- **Current**: Warnings are safe to ignore for MVP

### Debugging Strategies

**Local Development Issues**:
1. Clear all caches: `rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache`
2. Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
3. Check Next.js config for conflicts
4. Verify port 3000 is not in use

**AWS Deployment Issues**:
1. Check CloudFormation events in AWS Console
2. Verify AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
3. Ensure CDK is bootstrapped in target region
4. Check S3 bucket permissions and policies
